This is aimed to be a collection of anonymously submitted paranormal stories and keep an archive that can be read by whoever visits the site. The features used in this project are as followed: 
1. Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify.  Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file).
2. Interact with a database to store and retrieve information (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, etc).
3. Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc).

Here's the steps to run the project:
1. Clone github repo.
2. Open Visual Studio Code.
3. Open terminal in VS Code and make sure you are in the correct directory.
4. Type 'npm i express mongoose' and press enter.
5. Type 'npm start' and press enter.
6. Open browser and type 'localhost:3000' into the address bar and press enter to view the project.
7. Feel free to add your own story if desired.
