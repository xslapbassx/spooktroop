          Have you ever experienced something that you couldn't quiet explain? Seen something that makes you
          question your eyes or even your sanity? Or, just generally having something that terrified you? If
          so, come have a seat next to the fire. Stay a while and rest yourself by it's warmth. Toss your own
          tale in to the fire for kindling, keeping the fire burning, or just enjoy yourself a nice, spooky story.
          Enjoy you stay, friend.
